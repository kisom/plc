#+TITLE: A Propositional Logic Checker

* Introduction and Motivation

  While reading The Little Prover and working through Write Yourself a
  Scheme in 48 Hours, it seemed like it would be an interesting
  intellectual challenge to write a prover for simple propositional
  logic. This is that attempt.

* Source files

  The implementation is covered in:

  + Data.Logic.Propositional.Class contains the type definitions for
    propositional logic theorems.

  + Data.Logic.Propositional.Parser contains the parser for reading
    theorems from a string.
